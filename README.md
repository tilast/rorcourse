# Simple Task Manager for Ruby Garage

## About
STM uses **PHP-script** as *server* side and **JavaScript** with jQuery for *client* side. So you need **PHP>5.3v**.
For *layout* was used **HTML5** and **CSS3**, so you need modern browser(in old browsers all functional will work, but there will not some beautiful things).

## Install
STM uses **SQLite**, so you don't need to upload dumps into db. You simply use it.
You have to change directory of this project on your server in file *static/config.php*.
